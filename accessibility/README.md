# Web Accessibility

## Course Description

Learn how we can write code that helps to remove barriers that exclude people with disabilities from accessing and engaging with Web content.  

Lectures will provide an overview of how people with a varied range of disabilities use and access content on the Web. 

Exercises will take students through the process of modifying existing code to make site content and functionality more accessible to people with varying abilities. 

All topics are mapped to one or more of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as appropriate.
