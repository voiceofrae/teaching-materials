#GDI SF HTML/CSS Workshop Follow-Up

Hi all!

Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs **[TODO:TA names]** for being such great helpers. We’d love your feedback on the class [in this survey](https://docs.google.com/a/girldevelopit.com/forms/d/1nwx55EOUjoTH7uhVs1vYNRlFVUl6x4s1t4SBr3OHqXQ/viewform).

The course will remain online at http://khanacademy.org/html-css for you to continue working through. Our shared doc will remain at [TODO:shared doc url] 

## Practice, Practice:
There are study groups every Monday and Wednesday through [Women Who Code](http://www.meetup.com/women-who-code-sf/). We also have PairUps every few Saturdays. THose are a great opportunity to work on exercises or your own personal blog/website. RSVP on Meetup: **[TODO: meetup URL]**

## Future Classes
Now that you've learned the basics of HTML and CSS, you can learn more CSS techniques:
**[TODO: meetup URL for CSS Tools & Techniques]**

You might also want to browse through [these CSS3 slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10998095/css3-workshop/index.html#slide1).

You hopefully also want to learn JavaScript, the language we use for making webpages interactive. We’ll hold JS 101 **[TODO: insert JS 101 date]**. You can RSVP here: **[TODO: meetup URL]**.


After that, we’ll have more advanced JS workshops **[TODO: insert dates and examples]** to give you a full tour of Front End Web Development. If you can’t make JS 101 or want to get a head start, you can work on it on your own on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).

Looking forward to seeing you at future workshops!
