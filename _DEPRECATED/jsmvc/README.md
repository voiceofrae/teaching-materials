# JavaScript MVC

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/jsmvc).

## Course description

Nowadays, we are using JavaScript more and more on our webpages, and that means that we can end up with hundreds or even thousands of lines of JS. If you're not careful, your code can quickly become an unnavigable maze of spaghetti code. In this workshop, you'll learn how to use an MVC architecture to help modularize your code, make it more re-usable, and better separate the presentation from the data.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs, and will be taught by [teacher X, tiny bio]. 
This workshop is highly recommended for anyone attending our frontend workshop series.
