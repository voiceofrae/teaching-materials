# GDI SF JS 102 Workshop Follow-Up

Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs **[TODO: TA names]** for being such great helpers. We’d love your feedback on the workshop [in this survey](https://docs.google.com/a/girldevelopit.com/forms/d/1nwx55EOUjoTH7uhVs1vYNRlFVUl6x4s1t4SBr3OHqXQ/viewform).

The slides are available at:
http://www.teaching-materials.org/jsreview/
We will always keep them available at that URL.

Remember to keep practicing. You can try the [JS exercises on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript), finish the remaining JS challenges on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming?mp-r-id=BUjz9Xc=) (if that’s where you learned JS), work on the exercises from [our old JS 101](http://www.teaching-materials.org/javascript/) (CTRL-F for “exercise”), read these [review articles](http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2014/03/new-way-to-review-what-you-learn-in.html), come up with challenges for yourself, etc.

If you are coming to JS 200, then I also recommend reviewing a bit of HTML/CSS, like via [this review quiz](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/html-css-js-intro/a/review-htmlcss).

Hope to see you at future meetups!
