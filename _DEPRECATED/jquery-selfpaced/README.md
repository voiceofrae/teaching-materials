# Intro to jQuery: Making webpages interactive (Self-paced)

Slides and materials are hosted [on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/html-js-jquery).

## Course description

In this workshop, you'll learn how to use jQuery, the most popular library for making your webpages interactive with JavaScript.

This workshop will be largely "self-paced". That means that we'll start with a round of introductions and an overview, and then you'll watch videos and do coding challenges at your own pace, using [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/html-js-jquery). We will stop to work on pair projects every few hours, and we'll have TAs to answer questions and help when you get stuck.

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML/CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). Attendees should also have learned the DOM API (access and modication methods). That means that you either attended our HTML 101 workshop, JS 101 workshop, and JS for the Web workshop, or that you learned those concepts online. 

You can review them online at a few places:
* HTML/CSS: [Khan Academy's HTML/CSS course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css), [Codecademy's HTML/CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web), [GDI SF HTML/CSS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/htmlcss-1day)
* JS: [Codecademy's JS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript), [Khan Academy's Intro to JS course](https://khanacademy.org/programming),  [GDI SF JS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/javascript)
* DOM API: [Khan Academy's "Making Webpages Interactive" course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css-js)

### Tech requirements:

* Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay) and charger.
* A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox. 
* A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (free; available for both Mac and PC) or Notepad++ (PC).
