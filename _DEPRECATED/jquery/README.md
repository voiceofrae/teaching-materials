# Intro to jQuery

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/jquery).

## Course description

In this workshop, we will introduce jQuery, the most popular JavaScript library for making webpages interactive.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs, and will be taught by [teacher X, tiny bio].This is the perfect follow-up workshop for those who have attended our JS for the Web workshop.

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML/CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). Attendees should also have learned the DOM API (access and modication methods). That means that you either attended our HTML 101 workshop, JS 101 workshop, and JS for the Web workshop, or that you learned those concepts online.
