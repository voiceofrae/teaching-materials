# GDI SF JS 101 Workshop Follow-Up

Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs **[TODO: TA names]** for being such great helpers. We’d love your feedback on the workshop [in this survey](https://docs.google.com/a/girldevelopit.com/forms/d/1nwx55EOUjoTH7uhVs1vYNRlFVUl6x4s1t4SBr3OHqXQ/viewform).

We were very impressed by your questions and projects, such creativity! If you want to check out the code for each other’s projects, they’re linked from the shared doc: **[TODO: doc URL]**.

Our JS series will continue with JS 102 **[TODO: link]** on **[TODO: date]**, which is more practice with arrays, objects, and functions, and then with JS 200 **[TODO: link]** on **[TODO: date]**, which will show you how to combine JS with HTML/CSS, to make interactive webpages. 

**JS 102: Objects, Arrays, and Functions** is recommended but not required for JS 200, so it’s okay if you’re unable to make it. HTML/CSS is required for JS 200, so please learn that via [Khan Academy](https://docs.google.com/a/girldevelopit.com/forms/d/1nwx55EOUjoTH7uhVs1vYNRlFVUl6x4s1t4SBr3OHqXQ/viewform)/[TreeHouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)/[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) if you haven’t yet.

We will keep track of your progress through JS 101, as long as you added us as a KA coach (**[TODO: coach code]**). If you’re continuing on, your goal is to get through the [“Objects” challenges](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/objects/p/intro-to-objects), ending on [Project: Bookshelf](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/objects/p/project-bookshelf).

If you want to be in a room with TAs and fellow learners, I recommend the JS study group on Mondays and Wednesdays through [Women Who Code](http://www.meetup.com/women-who-code-sf/), or our PairUp events every few Saturdays.

Besides our GDI  workshops, here are some additional ways that you can continue to learn JS online, after you complete the Khan Academy course--

* **Online tutorials:** [TreeHouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/), [CodeSchool](http://www.codeschool.com/), [Basic JavaScript](http://www.2ality.com/2013/06/basic-javascript.html), [AppendTo](http://learn.appendto.com/)
* **Books:** [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (available online for free), [JS: the Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742)
* **Meetups:** [HackReactor](http://www.meetup.com/hackreactor/), [SFJS](http://www.meetup.com/jsmeetup/), [MakerSquare](http://www.meetup.com/MakerSquareSF/)
* Also check out our TA Yan’s [blog post](http://blog.fanofyan.com/how-i-started/) on how she got started in JS.

Hope to see you at future workshops!
