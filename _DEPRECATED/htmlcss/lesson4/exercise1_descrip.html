<h1>CSS 1: Selectors Exercise</h1>
<p>Starting with <a href="/htmlcss/lesson3/exercise_solution.html">the solution</a> from the HTML 2 exercise,
add CSS rules to the webpage so that it looks like the screenshot below.
All the CSS rules should have "color: red;" or "color:blue;" as the property-value pair, and just use different selector types to style the different parts of the page.
</p>
<p>Note that there are often multiple ways to achieve the same result in CSS. Try to use a mix of the different types of selectors- id, class, position in document, etc.
