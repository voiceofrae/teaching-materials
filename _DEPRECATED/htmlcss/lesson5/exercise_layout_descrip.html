<h1>CSS 2: Exercise</h1>
<p>The goal is to create a webpage that looks like the one below. Follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Copy <a href="/htmlcss/lesson4/exercise2_solution.html">this webpage</a> (the solution from the CSS properties exercise).
 <li>Add a div for all of the content. Add styles to that div so it is centered on the page and has appropriate border and padding.
 <li>Add a div for the header (the logo). Add styles to that div so the image is centered.
 <li>Add a div for the footer links. Add styles to that div so that the links are centered and it has appropriate border, padding, and margin.
 <li>Add a div for the locations list. Add styles to that div so that it floats to the right and has appropriate border, padding, and color.
 <li>Bonus: Add a div with 00s and 11s. Add styles to that div so that it is positioned absolutely just above the bottom of the page and is below the main div.
</ul>
